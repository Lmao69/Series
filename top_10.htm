<body>
<h1>Rust Cohle (True Detective)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Matthew McConaughey<br>
If time is a flat circle, then this list must be a flat circle, too. According to that airtight stoner logic, Rust Cohle, the biker-gang-infiltrating, beer-can-sculpting, Nietzsche-quoting protagonist of HBO's star-studded noir anthology series, is actually number 100 and number 1, the alpha and the omega.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Dewey Wilkerson (Malcolm in the Middle)</h1>

<p>Played by Erik Per Sullivan<br>
Nowadays, most of the online literature about Malcolm in the Middle -- the genuinely progressive FOX series about how the American Dream meritocracy is essentially a lie -- is littered with "where's the cast now?" chum, reducing the sweet boy Dewey to a line about how old Erik Per Sullivan is now. </p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Olive Snook (Pushing Daisies)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Kristen Chenoweth<br>
It takes a lot to top the #relationshipgoals of Ned the Piemaker (Lee Pace) and his gloriously revitalized crush Chuck (Anna Friel), but Olive Snook, played with the special sort of motor-mouthed zing that only Broadway legend Kristen Chenoweth could muster, was the not-so-secret heart of Bryan Fuller's cult show, breathing the sunny lemonade zip of life into a premise that turned even the concept of death aslant.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Pope Pius XIII (The Young Pope)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Jude Law<br>
More meme than man to many, Pope Pius XIII, the domineering religious leader previously known as Lenny Belardo, was often overshadowed by his most ridiculous virtues.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Penny Hartz (Happy Endings)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Casey Wilson<br>
A sitcom is only as good as its ensemble and Happy Endings' ensemble places it among the most beloved yet tragically canceled shows.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Tina Belcher (Bob's Burgers)</h1>
<p><b>Voiced by Dan Mintz<br>
Tina Belcher was an instant phenomenon when Bob's Burgers came to FOX in 2011.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Maeve (Westworld)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Thandie Newton<br>
Look, Westworld is by no means a perfect show. HBO's big sci-fi swing is overstuffed, intentionally confusing, and often incredibly corny.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Dylan Maxwell (American Vandal)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Jimmy Tatro<br>
It's a feat of brilliance how immediately charming the hapless, oafish Dylan Maxwell, classic high school dudebro, is from his very first appearance on the first season of Netflix's mockumentary series about a school beset by an investigation into who "did the dicks," drawing a phallus on every single car in the teachers' parking lot.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Jack Bauer (24)</h1>
<p>Played by Kiefer Sutherland<br>
As the fictional Counter Terrorism Unit's busiest agent, Jack Bauer was in near-constant motion -- perpetually racing off to a new location to prevent an assassination, defuse a nuclear football, or kick a heroin addiction he developed while working undercover -- but Kiefer Sutherland brought a surprising stillness to the role that transformed his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Valerie Cherish (The Comeback)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Lisa Kudrow<br>
Lisa Kudrow will probably always be best-known as Phoebe from Friends, but her greatest creation is Valerie Cherish, a brilliant work of meta comedy.</b></p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>Dr. House (House)</h1>
<p><b>Played by Hugh Laurie<br>
Cantankerous, curmudgeon, another c-word that isn't fit to print: These things all describe Dr. Gregory House, the character English actor Hugh Laurie embodied over medical drama House's eight seasons, earning him six Emmy nods.</b></p>
